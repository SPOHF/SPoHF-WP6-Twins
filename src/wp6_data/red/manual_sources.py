"""Registry of red's manual-upload sources.

The one list of red :class:`ManualSource` descriptors fed by the manual
upload path (currently only Sijia). "Manual" data — for the status-page
coverage split — is defined as readings whose ``source`` matches one of
these, as distinct from automated feeds that also carry a metadata
``source`` (the LoRaWAN tables via MySQL, and a future letsgrow sync).

Add a descriptor here when red gains another manual source.
