"""TimescaleDB schema bootstrap and read helpers for the red twin.

Red's `readings` has a different column shape than blue's: a `source` column
(mutually exclusive data origins — manual / Neurath / legacy — see
``project_blue_project_vs_red_source`` memo, not a rename of blue's `project`)
plus a nullable `upload_id` FK to `manual_uploads` for rows that came from a
manual Excel upload.

The cagg + `sync_metadata` infrastructure is twin-agnostic and lives in
`wp6_data.db.schema`/`queries`; `ensure_schema_red` delegates to
`ensure_aggregates(pool)` after creating red's readings hypertable.
